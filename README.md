I trained my model to recognize three hand gestures:
  - V sign : Peace
  - Open palm : Stop
  - Thumbs up : Good job

1. Create a brief demo with Teachable Machine
  - Go to https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/
  - Follow the instrcutions for an Image Project (standard image model)
  - Train a model to recognize something from your webcam
  - Export your model, upload it!
  - Work off off this base code: https://editor.p5js.org/kongsally/sketches/QlyiZmMNp
  - Copy the base code into this web editor for [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/)
  - Replace the trained model link in the base code with a link to your trained model.
  - Code some kind of visual that reacts to the output of your classifier! See https://p5js.org/reference/ for reference

2. Create a program that uses gesture recognition
