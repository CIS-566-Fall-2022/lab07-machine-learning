I trained my model to recognize three hand gestures:
  - V sign : Peace
  - Open palm : Stop
  - Thumbs up : Good job

1. Create a brief demo with Teachable Machine
  - Go to https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/
  - Follow the instrcutions for an Image Project (standard image model)
  - Train a model to recognize something from your webcam
  - Export your model, upload it!
  - Copy the p5.js code snippet from the export pop-up.
  - Using [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/), code some visual that reacts to data from your trained model
2. Create a program that uses gesture recognition
